# Java Enterprise Online Project

This project involves the development of a comprehensive Spring/JPA Enterprise application with advanced features such as authentication and role-based access control. Leveraging the power of popular Java tools and technologies, the project is built using Maven, Spring MVC, Spring Security, JPA (Hibernate), REST (Jackson), Bootstrap (css,js), datatables, jQuery, and additional enhancements from Java 8, including Stream API and Time API. Data storage is handled seamlessly through PostgreSQL and HSQLDB databases.

## Key Features:
- **Authorization and Role-based Access:** The application incorporates a robust authorization system based on roles, ensuring secure access control.
- **Technology Stack:** Utilizes a versatile technology stack comprising Multi-module Maven, Spring MVC, Spring Security, REST (Jackson), and Java 8 Stream API.
- **Persistence:** Implements data persistence to both PostgreSQL and HSQLDB databases using Spring JDBC, JPA (Hibernate), and Spring Data JPA.
- **Controller Development:** Development and testing of REST and AJAX controllers, supported by over 100 JUnit5 tests, guaranteeing functionality and reliability.
- **Web-client Interface:** The web-client is designed with a user-friendly interface using Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, datatables, jQuery, XML (JAXB), and Web services, ensuring an engaging user experience.
- **Multithreading:** Incorporates multithreading capabilities to enhance performance and responsiveness.

## Motivation:
In the spirit of the ancient Chinese proverb, "When you hear something, you forget it. When you see something, you remember it. But only when you do something, you understand it." This project encourages hands-on participation, providing a practical understanding of the intricacies involved in developing a sophisticated Java Enterprise application.
